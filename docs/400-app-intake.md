# 4) Configure Application Intake

In this exercise, we will step through the initial configuration of the Application Intake application

Once you've set this up, any intake request that you approve will automatically provision the user to the specified development instance so that they can build apps using App Engine Studio (AES).


Navigate to All > App Engine Studio > Configuration > Properties, and set the sn_app_intake.instance_can_provision_users system property to true.

You are ready to onboard developers and and applications with ease.
