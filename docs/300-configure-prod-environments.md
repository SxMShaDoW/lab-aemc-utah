# 3) Configure Environments in Prod Instance

<button class="btn btn-green fs-3" disabled>Estimated Time to Complete: 10 minutes</button>

## Overview 

[Environment records](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=config-pipeline-environments.html&version=latest){:target="_blank"} <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> (`sn_pipeline_environment`) contain information about a ServiceNow instance and how to access it.

Environment records do not sync across instances so creation is required on all instances (production and sub-production).

Environment records are put together in a Pipeline to let App Engine Management Center know what path to promote applications to Production.

    end

```

{: .highlight}
> For this exercise, the specific Application Scope for the environments is not critical - Global is acceptable. Always check with your Platform Administrator for any company policies around **<a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=connection-alias.html&version=latest" target="_blank">Connection and Credential Aliases â†—</a>**.
>
> Only users with the **System Administrator** (admin) role can define instance credentials for environments. 
> 
> Users with the **App Engine Administrator** (`sn_app_eng_notify.app_engine_admin`) role can view environment records; however, the Instance credential field is not visible.

**Congratulations!**
You have now created your **Dev Environment** record in your Prod instance.
