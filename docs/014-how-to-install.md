Click **Opt-in** and agree to the ServiceNow terms and conditions to verify entitlements.

Click **Manage Entitlements** and set the ‘Entitlement Type’ value to **Entitle all Instances** (if you prefer to manually select which instances which will be affected, select Entitle Selected Instances).

## Install the App Engine Studio application

To install the App Engine Studio application (***com.snc.app-engine-studio***), log in to your **development** instance and navigate to the ServiceNow Store.

Use the search criteria to find the App Engine Studio application. Click Install / Update All.
