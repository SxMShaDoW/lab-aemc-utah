App Engine, powered by the Now Platform, fuels rapid delivery of Creator Workflows with great experiences for everyone. With more people building with less complexity, App Engine allows developers to create low-code apps fast, and safely scale cross-enterprise experiences that 
users love.

App Engine Studio is available with App Engine and is designed from the ground up to address low-code development needs. App Engine Studio enables professional developers, line of business technologists (citizen developers), and low-code developers to build applications individually or in collaborative teams on the same platform, resulting in faster time to value and better applications that scale without sprawl.

With guidance-driven development flows and pre-configured application templates, developers across the enterprise can build and deliver apps quickly. Developers can leverage many out-of-box components available through drag-and-drop interfaces to create fulfilling user experiences that are critical to end-user adoption. 

Administrators control which applications to deploy by reviewing and testing applications created by App Engine Studio developers â€“ and by delegating development to business units in your organization, administrators are freed up to address more strategic, system-wide issues.

*App Engine Studio application templates are not captured in update sets, however modifications to templates will be captured*

App Engine Studio is the ideal ServiceNow development environment for no-code and low-code application development for developers of all skill levels. Pro-code developers can use App Engine Studio as a starting point for application development and easily transfer their applications to ServiceNow Studio when advanced configurations are necessary. 

Since development is supported between the two environments, low-code and pro-code developers can easily collaborate to deliver custom applications.

All configurations to an application, whether performed in App Engine Studio or ServiceNow Studio, can be captured in the same private application scope. Application artifacts configured in App Engine Studio can also be managed in ServiceNow Studio. However, some application artifacts can only be accessed and configured in ServiceNow Studio. These include business rules, notifications, and service portal pages.
