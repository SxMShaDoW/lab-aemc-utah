*Repeat steps across all sub-production instances, as necessary*

{: .note }
> If you plan on cloning your production instance to one or more non-production instances, you should also install the AES product on your production instance prior to cloning.
>
> Additionally, the AEMC plugin must be installed on all instances to appropriately collect application and developer data on development.

The App Engine Studio bundle has three Guided Setup modules to assist in configuration:
- **[App Engine Studio â€“ Configuration Guided Setup](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=configure-aes.html&version=latest)**
  - Configure foundational application components and provision initial user access
- **[Pipeline and Deployment Guided Setup](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=config-p-and-d.html&version=latest)**
  - Configure pipelines to deploy applications across instances with confidence
- **[Application Intake Guided Setup](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=config-app-intake.html&version=latest)**
  - Configure application intake catalog item and process to enable business users to submit application requests from an existing service portal.

{: .note}
> **App Engine Management Center** is dependent on the configuration of **Pipelines and Deployment**, and optionally **Application Intake**
> 
> For more information, see **[Product Documentation: Using Guided Setup](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=guided-setup.html&version=latest)**

In this lab, we will be going through the same steps covered in the Guided Setup, but we will not be utilizing Guided Setup.

## Service Accounts

At a point in the setup of the Pipeline, you will need to provide a Service Account that can be used by the instances to communicate with each other.  Check with your company policy on Service Accounts for requirements.

> Your Lab instance has a Service Account already pre-configured to use in the lab.
