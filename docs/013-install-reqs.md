> Before installing App Engine Studio, review all platform requirements and define an organizational instance strategy to prepare for successful installation and configuration.

# Platform requirements
 
## App Engine license
Contact your ServiceNow Account Manager for additional information on App Engine, or see [ServiceNow App Engine](https://www.servicenow.com/products/now-platform-app-engine.html).

## admin role
**admin** role is required in all instances to install App Engine applications from the ServiceNow Store.

# Define instance strategy

When defining the instance strategy for App Engine Studio, it is recommended to leverage one production instance and at least two sub-production instances â€“ however App Engine Studio can support any number of sub-production instances as part of an instance strategy.

Applications are deployed to the production instance once developed and successfully tested in sub-production instances. One sub-production instance will serve as the development environment, and the other as the test environment.

If your organization uses sandbox or staging environments in addition to test and development, they can be incorporated to the instance strategy accordingly based on organizational needs.

*Example instance strategy with one production instance and three sub-production instances*

Sub-production instances that are most similarly configured to your production instance are the best candidates for test and stage environments. This way, administrators can more accurately find issues that may arise if the application is deployed to production.

# Install 'Deployment Pipeline' plugin in each instance

To install the Deployment Pipeline plugin, (***com.snc.deployment-pipeline***), login to any instance and navigate to **System Definition** >> **Plugins**.

Use the search criteria to find the application. Click **Install**.

Repeat and install the Deployment Pipeline plugin in each sub-production instance.

# Service Accounts

At a point in the setup of the Pipeline, you will need to provide a Service Account that can be used by the instances to communicate with each other.  Check with your company policy on Service Accounts for requirements.
